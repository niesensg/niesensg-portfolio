This repository includes dashboards and data visualizations from several of my classes, including STA 309.

education_dashboard:
This is the final dashboard from my midterm project for STA309. Given a dataset with math and reading proficiency scores of US students as well as demographic data for US school districts, I decided to focus on my home state of Missouri, highlighting the relationship between poverty and academic performance.

heart_dashboard:
This final project for STA309 worked with heart disease data had two parts. As students are still given a similar assignment, I have only uploaded the dashboard from the Part 2.
In Part 1 of this project, I modeled the risk of heart disease based on the variables present in the data. I achieved this by using a 5-fold cross validation study with 10 repeats as well as using RandomForest. I determined which variables were most important using RandomForest's importance values.
In Part 2, I created several data visualizations in order to create a dashboard about cardiovascular health risks. I focused on the variables with the highest importance values: Cholesterol, Age, and Fasting Blood Sugar. The final dashboard was saved as a png file (heartDashboard.png).
